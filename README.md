# Caesar Cipher Brute-Force Cracker

Unveil the secrets hidden by the Caesar cipher with this powerful brute-force cracker. The Caesar cipher, used by Julius Caesar, encrypts messages by shifting letters in the alphabet. With only 26 possible keys, this program rapidly decodes encrypted messages through an exhaustive search, providing you with all potential decrypted outputs. This technique, known as a brute-force attack, is a captivating way to uncover the original message even without knowing the encryption key.

## How to Use

1. Run the program in a compatible environment.
2. Input the encrypted message you want to crack.
3. The program will systematically decrypt the message for all possible keys.
4. Explore the decrypted outputs to find the meaningful message.

## Features

- Quickly decodes messages encrypted with the Caesar cipher.
- Conducts a brute-force attack by trying all 26 possible keys.
- Displays all potential decrypted messages for your review.
- Gain insight into the vulnerability of simple encryption methods.

## Instructions

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the program's directory.
3. Run the program using `python caesar_brute_force.py`.
4. Input the encrypted message you want to crack.
